**[Deploy to Salesforce](https://githubsfdeploy.herokuapp.com/app/githubdeploy/financialforcedev/fflib-apex-common-samplecode)**
(be sure to [deploy](https://githubsfdeploy.herokuapp.com/app/githubdeploy/financialforcedev/fflib-apex-common) fflib-apex-common first)

Samples code illustrating the Apex Enterprise Patterns library. This aim is to progress this out to a more full working sample application to better illustrate the patterns in presentations and articles. Dreamfoce 2013 is around the corner and there will be once again a session on these patterns, which will likely drive further content in this repository, watch this space!

**Update: 13th September:** This [blog entry] (http://andyinthecloud.com/2013/09/13/ideas-for-apex-enterprise-patterns-dreamforce-2013-session/) describes the features this sample application currently illustrates and some I'm planning to cover in the upcoming Dreamfroce 2013 session, feedback welcome!
